The fetus, neonate, elderly and euthyroid patients with underlying thyroid disease (e.g., Hashimoto's thyroiditis or with Grave's disease previously treated with radioiodine or surgery) are among those individuals who are particularly susceptible to iodine-induced hypothyroidism. Oral cholecystographic agents and amiodarone are slowly excreted, producing more prolonged hypothyroidism than parenterally administered iodinated contrast agents. Long-term amino-glu-tethimide therapy may minimally decrease T4 and T3 levels and increase TSH, although all values remain within normal limits in most patients.

Calcium carbonate may form an insoluble chelate with levothyroxine, and ferrous sulfate likely forms a ferric-thyroxine complex. Administer levothyroxine at least 4 hours apart from these agents. Patients treated concomitantly with orlistat and levothyroxine should be monitored for changes in thyroid function.

It should be noted that actions of particular beta-adrenergic antagonists may be impaired when the hypothyroid patient is converted to the euthyroid state. Short-term administration of large doses of glucocorticoids may decrease serum T3 concentrations by 30% with minimal change in serum T4 levels. However, long-term glucocorticoid therapy may result in slightly decreased T3 and T4 levels due to decreased TBG production (see above).","C0001554, C1533734, C0392756, C0547047, C0205100, C0439836, C0041403, C0041403, C0332152, C1522538, C0205216, C0392756, C0442797, C0041403, C0441889, C0229671, C1546774, C1550100, C0041403, C0441889, C3538928, C3888388, C0205307, C0439166, C2347086, C1998882, C0750482, C2937276, C0205217, C0442805, C0030705, C1522326, C0549177, C0178602, C0033497, C0014432, C1152555, C2756995, C1442061, C1442442, C1608330, C0439422, C0041403, C0041403, C0441889, C0392747, C0443172, C1705241, C0750482, C2937276, C0202230, C0205307, C0439166, C2347086, C0030705, C0117002, C1316572, C1317574, C0441472, C0001645, C0178504, C2757061, C0221099, C0020676, C0030705, C2360836, C2360838, C2360840, C0117002, C1301808, C1442792, C3148680, C0443303, C0001554, C1533734, C0549177, C0178602, C0017710, C3540777, C3540778, C0392756, C0547047, C0683149, C0041403, C0450371, C3845594, C0229671, C1546774, C1550100, C0041403, C0441889, C0443252, C0744425, C1274040, C1546471, C2825142, C0750482, C2937276, C0205216, C0392756, C0442797, C0041403, C004","Occupational Activity (ocac), Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure (topp), Qualitative Concept (qlco), Quantitative Concept (qnco), Spatial Concept (spco), Functional Concept (ftcn), Geographic Area (geoa), Geographic Area (geoa), Temporal Concept (tmco), Functional Concept (ftcn), Quantitative Concept (qnco), Qualitative Concept (qlco), Qualitative Concept (qlco), Geographic Area (geoa), Qualitative Concept (qlco), Body Substance (bdsu), Intellectual Product (inpr), Body Substance (bdsu), Geographic Area (geoa), Qualitative Concept (qlco), Qualitative Concept (qlco), Intellectual Product (inpr), Qualitative Concept (qlco), Quantitative Concept (qnco), Quantitative Concept (qnco), Temporal Concept (tmco), Qualitative Concept (qlco), Qualitative Concept (qlco), Quantitative Concept (qnco), Functional Concept (ftcn), Patient or Disabled Group (podg), Functional Concept (ftcn), Quantitative Concept (qnco), Quantitative Concept (qnco), Organic Chemical (orch), Pharmacologic Substance (phsu), Molecular Function (mo"

The fetus, neonate, elderly and euthyroid patients with underlying thyroid disease (e.g., Hashimoto's thyroiditis or with Grave's disease previously treated with radioiodine or surgery) are among those individuals who are particularly susceptible to iodine-induced hypothyroidism. Oral cholecystographic agents and amiodarone are slowly excreted, producing more prolonged hypothyroidism than parenterally administered iodinated contrast agents. Long-term amino-glu-tethimide therapy may minimally decrease T4 and T3 levels and increase TSH, although all values remain within normal limits in most patients.","C0443252, C1274040, C1546471, C2825142, C0018021, C0450371, C0030705, C0205211, C0020676, C0450371, C0030705, C0015965, C0242291, C1305737, C0021289, C2239178, C2939425, C0001792, C1999167, C0117002, C0030705, C0205263, C0061472, C0220839, C0204592, C0040128, C0677607, C0018213, C1522326, C0038894, C0038895, C0543467, C1274039, C3853799, C0027361, C0237401, C0220898, C0231204, C2827758, C0154159, C0203079, C0450442, C1254351, C1521826, C0002598, C0439834, C1688651, C0205172, C0439590, C0020676, C1521801, C1960405, C0443252, C0039798, C0087111, C1363945, C0392756, C0547047, C0041403, C0041403, C0441889, C0442805, C0042295, C0442816, C0030705","Temporal Concept (tmco), Functional Concept (ftcn), Idea or Concept (idcn), Finding (fndg), Pathologic Function (patf), Organism Attribute (orga), Patient or Disabled Group (podg), Qualitative Concept (qlco), Disease or Syndrome (dsyn), Organism Attribute (orga), Patient or Disabled Group (podg), Embryonic Structure (emst), Tissue (tisu), Anatomical Structure (anst), Age Group (aggp), Finding (fndg), Temporal Concept (tmco), Population Group (popg), Population Group (popg), Finding (fndg), Patient or Disabled Group (podg), Functional Concept (ftcn), Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein (aapp), Amino Acid, Peptide, or Protein (aapp), Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure (topp), Disease or Syndrome (dsyn), Disease or Syndrome (dsyn), Disease or Syndrome (dsyn), Functional Concept (ftcn), Biomedical Occupation or Discipline (bmod), Functional Concept (ftcn), Health Care Activity (hlca), Biomedical Occupation or Discipline (bmod), Professional or Occupational Group (prog), Population Group (popg), Human (humn), Organis"

It should be noted that actions of particular beta-adrenergic antagonists may be impaired when the hypothyroid patient is converted to the euthyroid state. Short-term administration of large doses of glucocorticoids may decrease serum T3 concentrations by 30% with minimal change in serum T4 levels. However, long-term glucocorticoid therapy may result in slightly decreased T3 and T4 levels due to decreased TBG production (see above).","C0001554, C1533734, C0392756, C0547047, C0205100, C0439836, C0041403, C0041403, C0332152, C1522538, C0205216, C0392756, C0442797, C0041403, C0441889, C0229671, C1546774, C1550100, C0041403, C0441889, C3538928, C3888388, C0205307, C0439166, C2347086, C1998882, C0750482, C2937276, C0205217, C0442805, C0030705, C1522326, C0549177, C0178602, C0033497, C0014432, C1152555, C2756995, C1442061, C1442442, C1608330, C0439422, C0041403, C0041403, C0441889, C0392747, C0443172, C1705241, C0750482, C2937276, C0202230, C0205307, C0439166, C2347086, C0030705, C0117002, C1316572, C1317574, C0441472, C0001645, C0178504, C2757061, C0221099, C0020676, C0030705, C2360836, C2360838, C2360840, C0117002, C1301808, C1442792, C3148680, C0443303, C0001554, C1533734, C0549177, C0178602, C0017710, C3540777, C3540778, C0392756, C0547047, C0683149, C0041403, C0450371, C3845594, C0229671, C1546774, C1550100, C0041403, C0441889, C0443252, C0744425, C1274040, C1546471, C2825142, C0750482, C2937276, C0205216, C0392756, C0442797, C0041403, C004","Occupational Activity (ocac), Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure (topp), Qualitative Concept (qlco), Quantitative Concept (qnco), Spatial Concept (spco), Functional Concept (ftcn), Geographic Area (geoa), Geographic Area (geoa), Temporal Concept (tmco), Functional Concept (ftcn), Quantitative Concept (qnco), Qualitative Concept (qlco), Qualitative Concept (qlco), Geographic Area (geoa), Qualitative Concept (qlco), Body Substance (bdsu), Intellectual Product (inpr), Body Substance (bdsu), Geographic Area (geoa), Qualitative Concept (qlco), Qualitative Concept (qlco), Intellectual Product (inpr), Qualitative Concept (qlco), Quantitative Concept (qnco), Quantitative Concept (qnco), Temporal Concept (tmco), Qualitative Concept (qlco), Qualitative Concept (qlco), Quantitative Concept (qnco), Functional Concept (ftcn), Patient or Disabled Group (podg), Functional Concept (ftcn), Quantitative Concept (qnco), Quantitative Concept (qnco), Organic Chemical (orch), Pharmacologic Substance (phsu), Molecular Function (mo"
